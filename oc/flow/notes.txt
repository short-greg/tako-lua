1. Removed mergeIn from flows 
(other than merge where it is necessary)
What if a particular item inside the control
structure is updated though?? (relaxed)
How should I deal with that?
2. If an item is updated or if a reference is updated
there is no way to deal with it unless there is
listening....  This is a flaw in the system 
right now.
